# Sorting-Visualizer
We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.  Thatâ€™s why I am making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project we also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.

Features:

1. Colored representation of step being executed. 1.1) Blue:default 1.2) Yellow: Being compared 1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 1.4) Green: In correct position
2. 3 Controls for visualizations 2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels) 2.2) Data size () 2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
3. Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
